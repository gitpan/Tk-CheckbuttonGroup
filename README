NAME
    Tk::CheckbuttonGroup - widget displays and manages a group of related
    checkbuttons

SYNOPSIS
            use Tk::CheckbuttonGroup;

            my($top) = MainWindow->new();
            my @selected = qw(two four);
            my $checkbuttongroup = $top->CheckbuttonGroup (
                    -list => [qw( one two three four five )],
                    -orientation => 'vertical',
                    -variable => \@selected,
                    -command => sub {
                            print @selected, "\n";
                    }
            );

WIDGET-SPECIFIC OPTIONS
    Name: list
    Class: List
    Switch: -list
        The names for the checkbuttons to be contained in this widget. If
        given as a list reference, the same value is used for the
        checkbutton's label and its value. If given as a hash reference, the
        keys are used as each checkbutton's label, and the values as their
        values. If given a list reference whose first element is a list
        reference, the sublist will be treated as a set of ordered key value
        pairs which is then treated as an ordered hash.

    Name: orientation
    Class: Orientation
    Switch: -orientation
        May be 'vertical' or 'horizontal'. Specifies how the checkboxes are
        stacked.

    Name: variable
    Class: Variable
    Switch: -variable
        A reference to an array, whose elements contain the values of all
        checked checkbuttons, and is updated as the user interacts with the
        widget. May also be a comma delimited string scalar. This variable
        is not watched, and so state of the widget is only updated by
        changing the -variable option.

    Name: command
    Class: Command
    Switch: -command
        Specifies a perl/Tk callback to associate with all of the
        checkbuttons.

DESCRIPTION
    Displays a set of related checkboxes with a frame in vertical or
    horizontal orientation.

    All checkboxes are advertised with the names given in the -list option.

    Any additional options which are given to this widget are applied to all
    of the checkbuttons it manages.

BUGS
    The reference passed in the -variable option is not watched, and so the
    checkbuttons will not automatically update themselves if the list given
    in that reference changes.
